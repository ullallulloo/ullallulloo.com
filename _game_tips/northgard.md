- The AI mainly uses throwing axemen to get high damage armies.
- Do not colonize the middle in a FFA game or you'll get destroyed from all sides. You only need to expand if you actually *need* something. Let your population build up peacefully.
- It takes a long time to rebuild an army. If you win a battle, you can basically just conquer their lands for like 5 minutes unless someone else attacks you during it.
- Assigning people as soldiers costs Kr√∂wns, which gets expensive.
- You lose a territory faster than your army can run across the map, so towers are important, even if they aren't very strong.
- You lose if your Town Hall gets destroyed. Since you start on the beach and since a lot of clans can summon soldiers on any beach tile, you *have to* build a tower by your town hall.
- You get people's buildings (even upgraded buildings, bonfires, and relics) when you conquer their land, so it's very good.
- You have to repair buildings in conquered lands before they burn down, and that has to be done by a villager, so you have to send other professions to a house or town hall first to be able to tell them to repair or build a tower.
- You can't attack territory without scouting it first, and you can't scout enemy territory without an upgraded scout, so you *always* have to upgrade your scout camp to be able to attack someone's town hall.
