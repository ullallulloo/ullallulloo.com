Beatstar is a surprisingly addictive game my wife introduced me to. To be honest, I installed it and grinded to level seven for the sole purpose of playing PSY's "Gangnam Style".

I got there before too long, and was <span lang="ko">ì˜¤</span>ing away when I became disappointed I could only play the song like three times before it would make me watch an ad or else not be able to play at all if it couldn't connect to the Internet. Since I use a system wide ad blocker, this made the game unplayable.

Confusingly, I couldn't see *why* it was blocking me. There was no indication of when I would be blocked or when I would be able to play again. From experience, it would do this until the next day, which seemed completely unreasonable.

My wife suggested that it might have something to do with the song cases, so I did some testing and sure enough, it will let me play as long as are case slots to fill up. Once I got three cases though, I would no longer be able to play.

The takeaway from this is that if you want to play Beatstar for more than just a few minutes at a time, it is important that early in the day you open the app and open a new case a couple times a few hours apart, so you will have plenty of space for new cases. Songs that don't give you cases, like the daily double purple coin songs and the challenge songs don't count against your limit. Hopefully these tips will make the game more playable for you like it did me.
