Beatstar is a surprisingly simple mobile game my wife introduced me to. It's literally just a copy of Piano Tiles but with popular songs. It reminds me of Guitar Hero but with phone tapping instead of a fake guitar.

There's really not that much to say about it. You get what you expect. The song drip is decent. There's a lot of ads if you want to do anything more than play it a handful of times per day ([it's rather essential to understand how the unintuitive limit works]({% link _game_tips/beatstar.md %})), but there are certainly worse monetization schemes. Overall it's fun, and I would recommend it.
