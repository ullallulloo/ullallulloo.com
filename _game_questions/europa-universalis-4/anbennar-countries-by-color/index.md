Whether in normal EU4 or in the land of Halann, the goal is typically to paint the world in your country's color. Thus, if you are going to spend forever staring at a map, you might as well make it a pretty one. This table lists the countries in the Anbennar mod by their colors so you can make sure you are always aesthetic.
